👋 Hi, I’m @0xRachael
- 👀 I’m interested in people ops and recruitment, specificially in the web3 space.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Gitcoin in a People Ops and Success role, focusing on improving and streamlining their recruitment resources and plan - both for the Holdings side as well as the DAO.

💞️ No current projects, but always up to chat about hobbies, recruitment, people ops, or NFTs.
- 📫 You can ping me on Discord: notdame#4187 or on Twitter: @rachaellamy
